# Compiler project
 Senior year project to create a language compiler. 
 much more in depth description to be written on my thoughts of creating a language translator.

As of 2-21:
First pass of tokenizer is complete. next to implement is to create a 'state' csv and to implement with
current switch-case, essentially making the lexical FSA.
