# Compiler project
 Senior year project to create a language compiler. 
 much more in depth description to be written on my thoughts of creating a language translator.

As of 2-21:
First pass of tokenizer is complete. next to implement is to create a 'state' csv and to implement with
current switch-case, essentially making the lexical FSA.

As of 4-24:
Syntax analyzer was completed which creates assembly x86 intermediate code which will run on a NASM assembler. This project is being moved from private to public now that the project has been completed. It should be noted this language translator is still in a fairly simple phase, not recognizing while loops, or function calls in Java 0. On the off chance anyone wants to steal this code for a future compiler class (assuming it is at the university I attended) I fully back the professor to slap you with a 0 for stealing code. Not to mention, if you put in the work, your translator can be *much* better than this.
